Laptop Theft Security Client
============================

### What is it?
Have you ever been working on your laptop at somewhere and wanted to leave the place you were sitting for a bit? Perhaps you want to go to the bathroom, or order a new cup of coffee, or just go for a walk. Your two usual options are:
     * Ask someone to watch your stuff for you - which is unnecessary interaction that can be bothersome to either you or the person you are asking
     * Hide your stuff - which is a lot of work, especially when you take into account hiding it and unhiding it
Laptop Theft Security Client, or LTSC, is an alternative, technological solution to this problem.
